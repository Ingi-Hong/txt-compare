A Frere ther was, a wantown and a merye,

A limitour, a ful solempne man.

 
In alle the ordres foure is noon that can

So muche of daliaunce and fair langage.

He hadde maad ful many a mariage

Of yonge wommen, at his owne cost.

Un-to his ordre he was a noble post.

 
Ful wel biloved and famulier was he

With frankeleyns over-al in his contree,

And eek with worthy wommen of the toun:

For he had power of confessioun,

As seyde him-self, more than a curat,

 
For of his ordre he was licentiat.

Ful swetely herde he confessioun,

And plesaunt was his absolucioun;

He was an esy man to yeve penaunce

Ther as he wiste to han a good pitaunce;

 
For unto a povre ordre for to yive

Is signe that a man is wel y-shrive.

For if he yaf, he dorste make avaunt,

He wiste that a man was repentaunt.

For many a man so hard is of his herte,

 
He may nat wepe al-thogh him sore smerte.

Therfore, in stede of weping and preyeres,


Men moot yeve silver to the povre freres.

His tipet was ay farsed ful of knyves

And pinnes, for to yeven faire wyves.

 
And certeinly he hadde a mery note;

Wel coude he singe and pleyen on a rote.

Of yeddinges he bar utterly the prys.

His nekke whyt was as the flour-de-lys;

Ther-to he strong was as a champioun.

 
He knew the tavernes wel in every toun,

And everich hostiler and tappestere

Bet than a lazar or a beggestere;

For un-to swich a worthy man as he

Acorded nat, as by his facultee,

 
To have with seke lazars aqueyntaunce.

It is nat honest, it may nat avaunce

For to delen with no swich poraille,

But al with riche and sellers of vitaille.

And over-al, ther as profit sholde aryse,

 
Curteys he was, and lowly of servyse.

Ther nas no man no-wher so vertuous.

He was the beste beggere in his hous;

  b
 And yaf a certeyn ferme for the graunt;

  c
Noon of his bretheren cam ther in his haunt; 

For thogh a widwe hadde noght a sho,

So plesaunt was his "In principio,"

 
Yet wolde he have a ferthing, er he wente.

His purchas was wel bettre than his rente.

And rage he coude, as it were right a whelpe.

   
In love-dayes ther coude he muchel helpe.

For there he was nat lyk a cloisterer,

 
With a thredbar cope, as is a povre scoler,

But he was lyk a maister or a pope.

Of double worsted was his semi-cope,

That rounded as a belle out of the presse.

    
Somwhat he lipsed, for his wantownesse,

 
To make his English swete up-on his tonge;

And in his harping, whan that he had songe,

His eyen twinkled in his heed aright,

   
As doon the sterres in the frosty night.



A Marchant was ther with a forked berd,

 
In mottelee, and hye on horse he sat,

Up-on his heed a Flaundrish bever hat;

His botes clasped faire and fetisly.

His resons he spak ful solempnely,

 
Souninge alway thencrees of his winning.

He wolde the see were kept for any thing

Bitwixe Middelburgh and Orewelle.

   
Wel coude he in eschaunge sheeldes selle.

This worthy man ful wel his wit bisette;

 
Ther wiste no wight that he was in dette,

So estatly was he of his governaunce,

With his bargaynes, and with his chevisaunce.

For sothe he was a worthy man with-alle,

But sooth to seyn, I noot how men him calle.



He shoop his ingot, in lengthe and eek in brede,

Of this teyne, with-outen any drede,

 
So slyly, that the preest it nat espyde;

And in his sleve agayn he gan it hyde;

And fro the fyr he took up his matere,

   
And in thingot putte it with mery chere,

And in the water-vessel he it caste

 
Whan that him luste, and bad the preest as faste,

'Look what ther is, put in thyn hand and grope,

Thow finde shalt ther silver, as I hope;

What, devel of helle! sholde it elles be?

Shaving of silver silver is, pardee!'

 
He putte his hond in, and took up a teyne

Of silver fyn, and glad in every veyne

Was this preest, whan he saugh that it was so.

   
'Goddes blessing, and his modres also,

And alle halwes have ye, sir chanoun,'

 
Seyde this preest, 'and I hir malisoun,

But, and ye vouche-sauf to techen me

This noble craft and this subtilitee,

I wol be youre, in al that ever I may!'

 . Tyrwhitt reads Of thilke; I propose—As of this teyne.    . E. What that heer is; rest Look what ther is.    . E. omits ll.  ,  . From Lichf.    . E. Hl. omit that; found in Cm. Cp. Pt. Ln.    . Hl. subtilite; Cm. sotylete; E. subtiltee; rest sotilte, sotiltie; see l.  .

Quod the chanoun, 'yet wol I make assay

 
The second tyme, that ye may taken hede

And been expert of this, and in your nede

Another day assaye in myn absence

   
This disciplyne and this crafty science.

Lat take another ounce,' quod he tho,

 
'Of quik-silver, with-outen wordes mo,

And do ther-with as ye han doon er this

With that other, which that now silver is.'

He putte his ounce of coper in the croslet,

And on the fyr as swythe he hath it set,

 
And caste in poudre, and made the preest to blowe,

And in his werking for to stoupe lowe,

As he dide er, and al nas but a Iape;

   
Right as him liste, the preest he made his ape;

And afterward in the ingot he it caste,

 
And in the panne putte it at the laste

Of water, and in he putte his owene hond.

And in his sleve  as ye biforn-hond

Herde me telle  he hadde a silver teyne.

He slyly took it out, this cursed heyne—

 
Unwiting this preest of his false craft—

And in the pannes botme he hath it laft;

And in the water rombled to and fro,

   
And wonder prively took up also

The coper teyne, noght knowing this preest,

 
And hidde it, and him hente by the breest,

And to him spak, and thus seyde in his game,

'Stoupeth adoun, by god, ye be to blame,

Helpeth me now, as I dide yow whyl-er,

Putte in your hand, and loketh what is ther.'



By our lady,' quod this chanoun, 'it is dere,

 
I warne yow wel; for, save I and a frere,

In Engelond ther can no man it make.'

'No fors,' quod he, 'now, sir, for goddes sake,

What shal I paye? telleth me, I preye.'

'Y-wis,' quod he, 'it is ful dere, I seye;

 
Sir, at o word, if that thee list it have,

Ye shul paye fourty pound, so god me save!

And, nere the freendship that ye dide er this

   
To me, ye sholde paye more, y-wis.'

This preest the somme of fourty pound anon

 
Of nobles fette, and took hem everichon

To this chanoun, for this ilke receit;

Al his werking nas but fraude and deceit.

'Sir preest,' he seyde, 'I kepe han no loos

    
Of my craft, for I wolde it kept were cloos;

 
And as ye love me, kepeth it secree;

For, and men knewe al my subtilitee,

By god, they wolden han so greet envye

   
To me, by-cause of my philosophye,

I sholde be deed, ther were non other weye.'
