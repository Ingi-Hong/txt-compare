I scowl with frustration at
myself in the mirror. Damn
my hair—it just won’t
behave, and damn Katherine
Kavanagh for being ill and
subjecting me to this ordeal. I
should be studying for my
final exams, which are next
week, yet here I am trying to
brush my hair into
submission. I must not sleep
with it wet. I must not sleep
with it wet. Reciting this
mantra several times, I
attempt, once more, to bring
it under control with the
brush. I roll my eyes in
exasperation and gaze at the
pale, brown-haired girl with
blue eyes too big for her face
staring back at me, and give
up. My only option is to
restrain my wayward hair in a
ponytail and hope that I look
semi-presentable.
Kate is my roommate, and
she has chosen today of all
days to succumb to the flu.
Therefore, she cannot attend
the interview she’d arranged
to do, with some megaindustrialist tycoon I’ve never
heard of, for the student
newspaper. So I have been
volunteered. I have final
exams to cram for and one
essay to finish, and I’m
supposed to be working this
afternoon, but no—today I
have to drive 165 miles to
downtown Seattle in order to
meet the enigmatic CEO of
Grey Enterprises Holdings,
Inc. As an exceptional
entrepreneur and major
benefactor of our university,
his time is extraordinarily
precious—much more
precious than mine—but he
has granted Kate an
interview. A real coup, she
tells me. Damn her
extracurricular activities.
Kate is huddled on the
couch in the living room.
“Ana, I’m sorry. It took me
nine months to get this
interview. It will take another
six to reschedule, and we’ll
both have graduated by then.
As the editor, I can’t blow
this off. Please,
” Kate begs
me in her rasping, sore throat
voice. How does she do it?
Even ill she looks gamine and
gorgeous, strawberry blond
hair in place and green eyes
bright, although now red
rimmed and runny. I ignore
my pang of unwelcome
sympathy.
“Of course I’ll go, Kate.
You should get back to bed.
Would you like some NyQuil
or Tylenol?”
“NyQuil, please. Here are
the questions and my digital
recorder. Just press record
here. Make notes, I’ll
transcribe it all.”
“I know nothing about
him,
” I murmur, trying and
failing to suppress my rising
panic.
“The questions will see
you through. Go. It’s a long
drive. I don’t want you to be
late.”
“Okay, I’m going. Get
back to bed. I made you some
soup to heat up later.” I stare
at her fondly. Only for you,
Kate, would I do this.
“I will. Good luck. And
thanks, Ana—as usual, you’re
my lifesaver.”
Gathering my backpack, I
smile wryly at her, then head
out the door to the car. I
cannot believe I have let Kate
talk me into this. But then
Kate can talk anyone into
anything. She’ll make an
exceptional journalist. She’s
articulate, strong, persuasive,
argumentative, beautiful—
and she’s my dearest, dearest
friend.
THE ROADS ARE CLEAR as I set
off from Vancouver,
Washington, toward Interstate
5. It’s early, and I don’t have
to be in Seattle until two this
afternoon. Fortunately, Kate
has lent me her sporty
Mercedes CLK. I’m not sure
Wanda, my old VW Beetle,
would make the journey in
time. Oh, the Merc is a fun
drive, and the miles slip away
as I hit the pedal to the metal.
My destination is the
headquarters of Mr. Grey’s
global enterprise. It’s a huge
twenty-story office building,
all curved glass and steel, an
architect’s utilitarian fantasy,
with GREY HOUSE written
discreetly in steel over the
glass front doors. It’s a
quarter to two when I arrive,
greatly relieved that I’m not
late as I walk into the
enormous—and frankly
intimidating—glass, steel,
and white sandstone lobby.
Behind the solid sandstone
desk, a very attractive,
groomed, blonde young
woman smiles pleasantly at
me. She’s wearing the
sharpest charcoal suit jacket
and white shirt I have ever
seen. She looks immaculate.
“I’m here to see Mr. Grey.
Anastasia Steele for
Katherine Kavanagh.”
“Excuse me one moment,
Miss Steele.” She arches her
eyebrow as I stand selfconsciously before her. I’m
beginning to wish I’d
borrowed one of Kate’s
formal blazers rather than
worn my navy-blue jacket. I
have made an effort and worn
my one and only skirt, my
sensible brown knee-length
boots, and a blue sweater. For
me, this is smart. I tuck one
of the escaped tendrils of my
hair behind my ear as I
pretend she doesn’t intimidate
me.
“Miss Kavanagh is
expected. Please sign in here,
Miss Steele. You’ll want the
last elevator on the right,
press for the twentieth floor.”
She smiles kindly at me,
amused no doubt, as I sign in.
She hands me a security
pass that has “visitor” very
firmly stamped on the front. I
can’t help my smirk. Surely
it’s obvious that I’m just
visiting. I don’t fit in here at
all. Nothing changes. I
inwardly sigh. Thanking her,
I walk over to the bank of
elevators and past the two
security men who are both far
more smartly dressed than I
am in their well-cut black
suits.
The elevator whisks me at
terminal velocity to the
twentieth floor. The doors
slide open, and I’m in another
large lobby—again all glass,
steel, and white sandstone.
I’m confronted by another
desk of sandstone and another
young blonde woman, this
time dressed impeccably in
black and white, who rises to
greet me.
“Miss Steele, could you
wait here, please?” She points
to a seated area of white
leather chairs.
Behind the leather chairs is
a spacious glass-walled
meeting room with an equally
spacious dark wood table and
at least twenty matching
chairs around it. Beyond that,
there is a floor-to-ceiling
window with a view of the
Seattle skyline that looks out
through the city toward the
Sound. It’s a stunning vista,
and I’m momentarily
paralyzed by the view. Wow.
I sit down, fish the
questions from my backpack,
and go through them,
inwardly cursing Kate for not
providing me with a brief
biography. I know nothing
about this man I’m about to
interview. He could be ninety
or he could be thirty. The
uncertainty is galling, and my
nerves resurface, making me
fidget. I’ve never been
comfortable with one-on-one
interviews, preferring the
anonymity of a group
discussion where I can sit
inconspicuously at the back
of the room. To be honest, I
prefer my own company,
reading a classic British
novel, curled up in a chair in
the campus library. Not
sitting twitching nervously in
a colossal glass-and-stone
edifice.
I roll my eyes at myself.
Get a grip, Steele. Judging
from the building, which is
too clinical and modern, I
guess Grey is in his forties:
fit, tanned, and fair-haired to
match the rest of the
personnel.
Another elegant, flawlessly
dressed blonde comes out of a
large door to the right. What
is it with all the immaculate
blondes? It’s like Stepford
here. Taking a deep breath, I
stand up.
“Miss Steele?” the latest
blonde asks.
“Yes,
” I croak, and clear
my throat. “Yes.” There, that
sounded more confident.
“Mr. Grey will see you in a
moment. May I take your
jacket?”
“Oh, please.” I struggle out
of the jacket.
“Have you been offered
any refreshment?”
“Um—no.” Oh dear, is
Blonde Number One in
trouble?
Blonde Number Two
frowns and eyes the young
woman at the desk.
“Would you like tea,
coffee, water?” she asks,
turning her attention back to
me.
“A glass of water. Thank
you,
” I murmur.
“Olivia, please fetch Miss
Steele a glass of water.” Her
voice is stern. Olivia scoots
up and scurries to a door on
the other side of the foyer.
“My apologies, Miss
Steele, Olivia is our new
intern. Please be seated. Mr.
Grey will be another five
minutes.”
Olivia returns with a glass
of iced water.
“Here you go, Miss
Steele.”
“Thank you.”
Blonde Number Two
marches over to the large
desk, her heels clicking and
echoing on the sandstone
floor. She sits down, and they
both continue their work.
Perhaps Mr. Grey insists
on all his employees being
blonde. I’m wondering idly if
that’s legal, when the office
door opens and a tall,
elegantly dressed, attractive
African American man with
short dreads exits. I have
definitely worn the wrong
clothes.
He turns and says through
the door,
“Golf this week,
Grey?”
I don’t hear the reply. He
turns, sees me, and smiles, his
dark eyes crinkling at the
corners. Olivia has jumped up
and called the elevator. She
seems to excel at jumping
from her seat. She’s more
nervous than me!
“Good afternoon, ladies,
”
he says as he departs through
the sliding door.
“Mr. Grey will see you
now, Miss Steele. Do go
through,
” Blonde Number
Two says. I stand rather
shakily, trying to suppress my
nerves. Gathering up my
backpack, I abandon my glass
of water and make my way to
the partially open door.
“You don’t need to knock
—just go in.” She smiles
kindly.
I push open the door and
stumble through, tripping
over my own feet and falling
headfirst into the office.
Double crap—me and my
two left feet! I am on my
hands and knees in the
doorway to Mr. Grey’s office,
and gentle hands are around
me, helping me to stand. I am
so embarrassed, damn my
clumsiness. I have to steel
myself to glance up. Holy
cow—he’s so young.
“Miss Kavanagh.” He
extends a long-fingered hand
to me once I’m upright. “I’m
Christian Grey. Are you all
right? Would you like to sit?”
So young—and attractive,
very attractive. He’s tall,
dressed in a fine gray suit,
white shirt, and black tie with
unruly dark copper-colored
hair and intense, bright gray
eyes that regard me shrewdly.
It takes a moment for me to
find my voice.
“Um. Actually—” I mutter.
If this guy is over thirty, then
I’m a monkey’s uncle. In a
daze, I place my hand in his
and we shake. As our fingers
touch, I feel an odd
exhilarating shiver run
through me. I withdraw my
hand hastily, embarrassed.
Must be static. I blink rapidly,
my eyelids matching my
heart rate.
“Miss Kavanagh is
indisposed, so she sent me. I
hope you don’t mind, Mr.
Grey.”
“And you are?” His voice
is warm, possibly amused,
but it’s difficult to tell from
his impassive expression. He
looks mildly interested but,
above all, polite.
“Anastasia Steele. I’m
studying English literature
with Kate, um … Katherine
… um … Miss Kavanagh, at
WSU Vancouver.”
“I see,
” he says simply. I
think I see the ghost of a
smile in his expression, but
I’m not sure.
“Would you like to sit?”
He waves me toward an Lshaped white leather couch.
His office is way too big
for just one man. In front of
the floor-to-ceiling windows,
there’s a modern dark wood
desk that six people could
comfortably eat around. It
matches the coffee table by
the couch. Everything else is
white—ceiling, floors, and
walls, except for the wall by
the door, where a mosaic of
small paintings hang, thirtysix of them arranged in a
square. They are exquisite—a
series of mundane, forgotten
objects painted in such
precise detail they look like
photographs. Displayed
together, they are
breathtaking.
“A local artist. Trouton,
”
says Grey when he catches
my gaze.
“They’re lovely. Raising
the ordinary to
extraordinary,
” I murmur,
distracted both by him and
the paintings. He cocks his
head to one side and regards
me intently.
“I couldn’t agree more,
Miss Steele,
” he replies, his
voice soft, and for some
inexplicable reason I find
myself blushing.
Apart from the paintings,
the rest of the office is cold,
clean, and clinical. I wonder
if it reflects the personality of
the Adonis who sinks
gracefully into one of the
white leather chairs opposite
me. I shake my head,
disturbed at the direction of
my thoughts, and retrieve
Kate’s questions from my
backpack. Next, I set up the
digital recorder and am all
fingers and thumbs, dropping
it twice on the coffee table in
front of me. Mr. Grey says
nothing, waiting patiently—I
hope—as I become
increasingly embarrassed and
flustered. When I pluck up
the courage to look at him,
he’s watching me, one hand
relaxed in his lap and the

“You wouldn’t dare!” I
growl at him, and from deep
inside I feel a familiar,
welcome excitement. He
cocks an eyebrow at me. Of
course he would. I glance
quickly at Kate across the
table. She’s watching us with
interest. I turn back to
Christian, narrowing my eyes
at him.
“You’d have to catch me
first—and I’m wearing flats,
”
I hiss.
“I’d have fun trying,
” he
whispers with a licentious
grin, and I think he’s joking.
I blush. Confusingly, I feel
better.
As we finish our dessert of
strawberries and cream, the
heavens open. We all leap up
to clear the plates and glasses
from the table, depositing
them in the kitchen.
“Good thing the weather
held off till we finished,
”
Grace says, pleased, as we
drift into the back room.
Christian sits down at the
shiny black upright piano,
presses the quiet pedal, and
starts to play a familiar tune
that I can’t immediately
place.
Grace asks me for my
impressions of Saint-Paul-deVence. She and Carrick had
gone years ago during their
honeymoon, and it occurs to
me that this is a good omen,
seeing how happy they are
together now. Kate and Elliot
are cuddling on one of the
large overstuffed couches,
while Ethan, Mia, and
Carrick are deep in a
conversation about
psychology, I think.
Suddenly, as one, all the
Greys stop talking and gape
at Christian.
What?
Christian is singing softly
to himself at the piano.
Silence descends on us all as
we strain to hear his soft,
musical voice and the lyrics
of “Wherever You Will Go.”
I’ve heard him sing before;
haven’t they? He stops,
suddenly conscious of the
deathly hush that’s fallen
over the room. Kate glances
questioningly at me and I
shrug. Christian turns on the
stool and frowns,
embarrassed to realize he’s
become the center of
attention.
“Go on,
” Grace urges
softly. “I’ve never heard you
sing, Christian. Ever.” She
stares at him in wonder. He
sits on the piano stool,
looking absently at her, and
after a beat, he shrugs. His
eyes flicker nervously to me,
then over to the French
windows. The rest of the
room suddenly erupts in selfconscious chatter, and I’m
left watching my dear
husband.
Grace distracts me,
grasping my hands then
suddenly folding me in her
arms.
“Oh, darling girl! Thank
you, thank you,
” she
whispers, so only I can hear.
It brings a lump to my throat.
“Um …” I hug her back,
not really sure why I am
being thanked. Grace smiles,
her eyes shining, and kisses
my cheek. What have I done?
“I am going to make some
tea,
” she says, her voice
hoarse with unshed tears.
I amble over to Christian,
who is now standing, staring
out through the French
windows.
“Hi,
” I murmur.
“Hi.” He puts his arm
around my waist, pulling me
to him, and I slip my hand
into the back pocket of his
jeans. We gaze out at the rain.
“Feeling better?”
I nod.
“Good.”
“You certainly know how
to silence a room.”
“I do it all the time,
” he
says, and he grins at me.
“At work, yes, but not
here.”
“True, not here.”
“No one’s ever heard you
sing? Ever?”
“It appears not,
” he says
dryly. “Shall we go?”
I gaze up at him, trying to
gauge his mood. His eyes are
soft and warm and slightly
bemused. I decide to change
the subject.
“You going to spank me?”
I whisper, and suddenly there
are butterflies in my stomach.
Perhaps this is what I
need … this is what I have
been missing.
He gazes down at me, his
eyes darkening.
“I don’t want to hurt you,
but I’m more than happy to
play.”
I glance nervously around
the large room, but we are out
of earshot.
“Only if you misbehave,
Mrs. Grey.” He bends and
murmurs in my ear.
How can he put so much
sensual promise into six
words?
“I’ll see what I can do.” I
grin.
ONCE WE’VE SAID OUR goodbyes, we walk over to the car.
“Here.” Christian throws
me the keys to the R8. “Don’t
bend it”—he adds in all
seriousness—“or I will be
fucking pissed.”
My mouth goes dry. He’s
letting me drive his car? My
inner goddess whips on her
leather driving gloves and flat
shoes. Oh yes! she cries.
“Are you sure?” I mouth,
stunned.
“Yes, before I change my
mind.”
I don’t think I have ever
grinned so hard. He rolls his
eyes and opens the driver’s
door so that I can climb in. I
start the engine before he’s
even reached the passenger
side, and he jumps in quickly.
“Eager, Mrs. Grey?” he
asks with a wry smile.
“Very.”
Slowly, I ease the car
backward and turn it in the
driveway. I manage not to
stall it, surprising myself.
Boy, is the clutch sensitive.
Carefully navigating the
driveway, I glance in my
rearview mirror and see
Sawyer and Ryan climb into
the Audi SUV. I had no idea
our security had followed us
here. I pause before I set out
onto the main road.
“You’re sure about this?”
“Yes,
” Christian says
tightly, telling me he’s not
sure about this at all. Oh, my
poor, poor Fifty. I want to
laugh at both him and myself
because I’m nervous and
excited. A small part of me
wants to lose Sawyer and
Ryan just for the kicks. I
check for traffic then inch the
R8 out onto the road.
Christian curls up with
tension and I can’t resist. The
road is clear. I put my foot
down on the gas and we shoot
forward.
“Whoa! Ana!” Christian
shouts. “Slow down—you’ll
kill us both.”
I immediately ease off the
gas. Wow, can this car move!
“Sorry,
” I mutter, trying to
sound contrite and failing
miserably. Christian smirks at
me, to hide his relief, I think.
“Well, that counts as
misbehaving,
” he says
casually, and I slow right
down.
I glance in the rearview
mirror. No sign of the Audi
SUV, just a solitary dark car
with tinted windows behind
us. I imagine Sawyer and
Ryan flustered, frantic to
catch up, and for some reason
this gives me a thrill. But not
wanting to give my dear
husband a coronary, I decide
to behave and drive steadily,
with growing confidence,
toward the 520 bridge.
Suddenly, Christian swears
and struggles to pull his
BlackBerry from the pocket
of his jeans.
“What?” he snaps angrily
at whoever it is on the other
end of the line. “No,
” he says
and glances behind us. “Yes.
She is.”
I briefly check the rearview
mirror, but I don’t see
anything odd, just a few cars
behind us. The SUV is about
four cars back, and we’re all
cruising at an even pace.
“I see.” Christian sighs
